This directory will contain our frontend mobile application.
We will be using Expo for development of React Native.

### Setup on your machine

- Move into the frontend directory
  - cd frontend
- Install dependencies
  - npm install

### Running the app

- Start the server (from the frontend directory)
  - npx expo start
- Scan the QR code with your phone or choose an option on your computer

### Navigation

`frontend/index.ts` starts Expo Router; it is the entry point configured in
`package.json`. `app/index.tsx` is a different file: it redirects the root
route `/` to `/find-drivers` and is hidden from the tab bar.

`app/_layout.tsx` defines `NavBar`, with **Find Drivers**, **Map**, and **Profile**
tabs. Each tab's title is also its screen header. Each route file contains its
screen component directly:

- `app/find-drivers.tsx` defines `FindDriversScreen`.
- `app/map.tsx` defines `MapScreen`.
- `app/profile.tsx` defines `ProfileScreen`.

The screens share `components/placeholder-screen.tsx` and
`constants/screen-styles.ts`. Update those files to change all placeholder cards.
Build each feature in its route file and keep reusable components in
`components/`, which also contains `user-card.tsx`. Driver search, the interactive
map, and profile editing are future work.

The tab bar's height includes the device's bottom safe area so controls stay
above the home indicator. It does not add a separate minimum-height gap.
The unused `App.tsx` starter has been removed.

Keep `package-lock.json` committed alongside dependency changes. It records exact
versions for consistent installs across teammates and supports `npm ci`.

### Verify changes

- Install dependencies with `npm ci` (Node.js 22.13 or newer).
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck`.
- Run `npx expo start`, then open the app in Expo Go.
- Confirm Find Drivers appears first. Tap Map, Profile, and Find Drivers and
  confirm the screen title and selected tab change together.
- Check that only three tabs appear, the header matches the selected screen, and
  the tab bar reaches the bottom safe area without an extra blank strip.
- Open `/`, `/find-drivers`, `/map`, and `/profile` in the browser to check routes.
- For browser preview, run `npm run web`.
